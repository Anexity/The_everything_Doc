           Today was a relatively normal day, but since this is the start of the official
           entry base in this Site, ill still document it. Did some easy website work and learned about JS, saw how terrible
           having a database would be to implement at my current level of skill, was at work and feel like im starving because
           my entire body is failing again. However nothing much out of the ordinairy, still next weekends a long weekend,
           maybe ill get to fuck around with some VFX for private use again.
