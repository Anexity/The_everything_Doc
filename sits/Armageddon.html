            The "TO" Merchline is again kind of peeking my interest. I wanna make tastefully offensive references and in 
            way relate them to armageddon as if they were an organisation with rather ruthless ideas. <br>
            Got back to This idea after seeing City Morgues Merchandise and I really fuck with the "Bombs in the Mail"
            Idea.
